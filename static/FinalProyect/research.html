                <p>Climate change is affecting essential processes of many organisms, such as growth, reproduction and survival of the first vital phases, and may compromise the viability of some populations. </br>
                Ecosystems such as wetlands are at risk of disappearing entirely, and species such as the brown bear or cork oak are in danger of becoming extinct.</br>
                On the other hand, we find a proliferation of invasive species, such as jellyfish or tiger mosquitoes, to the detriment of other native species, such as sea snails and the African snail.</br>
                The birds are also changing their migratory patterns, staying in warmer latitudes.</br>
                In the seas, there is a decrease in algae species, such as red algae in the Cantabrian Sea. Mediterranean coral reefs are severely affected. In addition, the increase in water temperature caused by climate change has triggered the mortality rates of posidonia.</p>

                   <h3>Wildfires</h3>
                    <p>Climate change will transform the fire regime in the coming years, causing more intense phenomena and greater deforestation due to the decrease in the resilience of forests.</br>
                    The increase in the average temperature and the decrease in rainfall will create the ideal breeding ground for fires, especially in high mountain areas. In addition, they increasingly exceed 500 hectares (the so-called "Large Forest Fires") and are more virulent and difficult to combat.</br>
                    In the last two years the average of the last decade has been exceeded, with a greater number of forest fires, affected areas and large fires. The most dangerous thing about these fires, apart from their size, is their speed of expansion.</p>

                  <p>Over the past 30 years the total area of Arctic sea ice has decreased in summer. This not only causes major changes in local Arctic ecosystems, but it also affects climate systems around the world. The thickness of Arctic ice has decreased by 40% in the last 30 years.</br>
                  Both observational and modeling studies indicate that as Arctic land ice (that of glaciers) disappears, sea levels are likely to rise and climate patterns in the northern hemisphere change. The effects are likely to vary by geographic area, with some experiencing hotter and drier summers, others more rainy summers while others will have colder winters and more storms. Changes in atmospheric circulation patterns, including a change in the trajectory of the Gulf Stream, as well as a "blockage" of planetary atmospheric waves, are likely to contribute to these extreme climate changes. It is also likely that extreme weather events will be more common in the future, there will be more likelihood of heat waves, floods and very intense storms.</p>

                  <h3>Sea Level Rise</h3>
                  <p>The rising of the oceans varies according to the regions of the world and threatens, above all, the inhabitants of the islands and coastal areas. Some 745 million people will live in the coming decades exposed to floods, storm surges and other extreme phenomena that are increasingly frequent and devastating for human life and the environment, as the IPCC warned at the end of 2019 in a special report on oceans. and cryosphere.</br>
                  The rise in the sea level can also aggravate the erosion of the coastlines, worsen the quality of drinking and irrigation water, damage the historical and artistic heritage, affect transport and economic activity in cities, and submerge farmland, landscapes. natural, dwellings and even entire populations, turning their inhabitants into climate refugees.</p>

                    <h3>Desertification</h3>
                    <p>Drylands account for 41% of the planet's land surface and housed in 2000 a third of the human population, that is, 2,000 million people.</br>
                    
                    Ecosystem services are the benefits that man derives from ecosystems; for example, crops, forage and timber. In drylands, the production of these ecosystem services is limited by scarcity of water. The substantial and persistent reduction in the supply of these services, caused by water scarcity, intensive use of services and climate change, poses a much greater threat in drylands than in other systems. The areas most vulnerable to desertification are the sub-Saharan and Central Asian drylands.</br>
                    
                    Approximately 10-20% of drylands are already degraded and, if no action is taken, desertification will jeopardize future advances in human well-being and possibly lose the well-being gained in some regions. Therefore, desertification is currently one of the greatest environmental challenges and a major obstacle in meeting the basic needs of man in the drylands.</p>

                    <h3>Heat waves</h3>
                    <p>The planet's temperature is increasing due to a higher concentration of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) in the atmosphere. These retain heat, and are generated mainly by human activity. The main sources of greenhouse gas emissions are energy production and consumption, transportation, waste generation and changes in land use.
                    The increase in temperatures has been especially high in the last three decades (1975-2005), with an average rate of warming of about 0.5 degrees Celsius per decade.</br>
                    Temperatures are expected to rise to 6 degrees Celsius in 2100, which will cause increased arid conditions, as well as more extreme precipitation events. Which means the most unforgiving and long-lasting heat waves in summer.</p>

                  <h3>Extreme Weather Events</h3>
                  <p>Exceeding the 1,5 degrees Celsius limit would lead to a further increase in extreme heat, torrential rains and the probability of droughts. The tropicalization of the oceans leads to a higher rate of evaporation and, therefore, an increase in cloudiness, which facilitates the formation of strong storms and other meteorological phenomena.</br>
                  Wetter winters and a warmer sea will increase the risk of flash floods. Climate-related extremes have been costing you about 1 billion a year since 1980. Drought is one of our priority problems.</br> </br>
                  In 2005 we had the highest hurricane activity on record in the Atlantic, but 2017 was the first time a hurricane grazed the shores of Europe, and a Category 5 hurricane formed outside the Caribbean. And this is because we have a warmer ocean every time.</p>
